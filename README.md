Using the dataset shared with you, please share with us an exploratory fractal analysis of the data.
Signal 1 and Signal 2 are the two features and the classes are labelled as A, B and C. Based on your
work, we want to understand which class of data is more complex and why. Therefore, your
analysis must also include a statistical comparison of the 3 classes and the methods you chose.
Please note:

• You must use two or more fractal dimension methods to describe the data
• Feel free to use any Python package of your choice. There are several great and freely
available packages to do fractal analysis in GitHub.
• Please use appropriate statistical test(s) to tell us which fractal analysis method gives better
results
